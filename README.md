CS-370 Portfolio Submission

#### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, the code to train a Deep Q-Learning Network was implemented in a Python Jupyter notebook.
The code to define the map, determine completion, and to define the neural network was provided.  The code
I wrote for this project implemented a Greedy-Epsilon strategy with a decaying exploration ratio.

#### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence have experience exponential improvements in capabilities in recent 
years.  The ethical implications of these advances for society are still being understood, and this course
focused considerable attention on the role computer scientists will play in shaping how the world adapts to
increasingly sophisticated uses of these technologies.


#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists design software to solve problems, in particular, problems that involve computation.  Using
machines to automate increasingly complex tasks allows humans to both solve more problems in less time, and to
solve problems that would not be feasible to solve otherwise.  

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by first defining it formally.  Often, this includes documenting the 
input, processing, and output that is required to solve the problem.  With this problem definition, an architecture 
for a solution is proposed, tests to verify the problem is solved correctly are created, the process is documented, 
and all of this is done with appropriate security being implemented. 

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Software Developers have an ethical obligation to design software that complies with with rules, regulations,
applicable laws, and ethical codes such as the Association for Computation Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
While software is a powerful tool used to improve the world, it can also be abused.  When working on behalf of an organization,
software developers have an additional obligation to follow the rules of that organization, and to act in its best interests.
